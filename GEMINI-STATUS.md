# Gemini Integration Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working
- **API Key**: Successfully configured and loaded
- **Local Models (Mistral)**: Working perfectly via LiteLLM/Ollama  
- **Service**: Running on localhost:5002
- **Gemini Client**: Initializes successfully with API key

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue
**Gemini response parsing failing**
- Gem API calls succeed (tested directly in container)
- Response has valid candidates and parts
- Our code can't extract text from parts (returns empty)
- Root cause: Unknown - possibly protobuf serialization issue or version mismatch

## üîß Quick Workaround
Use local models for now while we debug Gemini:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/chat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "mistral-7b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## üìù Next Steps
1. Check google-generativeai library version compatibility
2. Try different response parsing approach  
3. Or: Accept local-only for now and revisit Gemini later

## üí° Recommendation
**Use Mistral for now** - it works great, is fast, and runs locally (private).
Gemini can wait until we have more time to debug the parsing issue.

Your service is **100% functional** with local AI models!
